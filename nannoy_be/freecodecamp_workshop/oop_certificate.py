# In this project, you will use object-oriented programming to create a Rectangle class and a Square class. The Square class should be a subclass of Rectangle and inherit its methods and attributes.

# Objective: Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

# User Stories:

# You should create a Rectangle class.

# When a Rectangle object is created, it should be initialized with width and height attributes. The class should also contain the following methods:

# set_width: Sets the width of the rectangle.
# set_height: Sets the height of the rectangle.
# get_area: Returns area ( width×height
#  ).
# get_perimeter: Returns perimeter  2(width+height)
#  .
# get_diagonal: Returns diagonal  width2+height2−−−−−−−−−−−−−−√
#  .
# get_picture: Returns a string that represents the shape using lines of *. The number of lines should be equal 
# to the height and the number of * in each line should be equal to the width. 
# There should be a new line (\n) at the end of each line. If the width or height is larger than 50, 
# this should return the string: Too big for picture..
# # get_amount_inside: Takes another shape (square or rectangle) as an argument. Returns
#  the number of times the passed in shape could fit inside the shape (with no rotations). 
#  For instance, a rectangle with a width of 4 and a height of 8 could fit in two squares with sides of 4.
# # If an instance of a Rectangle is represented as a string, it should look like: Rectangle(width=5, height=10).

# # You should create a Square class that subclasses Rectangle.

# # When a Square object is created, it should be initialized with a single side length. The __init__ method 
# should store the side length in both the width and height attributes from the Rectangle class.

# The Square class should contain the following methods:

# set_width: Overrides the set_width method from the Rectangle class. It should set the width
#  and height to the side length.
# # set_height: Overrides the set_height method from the Rectangle class. It should set the width 
# and height to the side length.
# # set_side: Sets the height and width of the square equal to the side length.
# The Square class should be able to access the Rectangle class methods.

# If an instance of a Square is represented as a string, it should look like: Square(side=9).
